<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today I will explain to you what Firebase is and how you could use it to your advantage. If you ever wanted to build an app but you lacked resources on your developing platform, tbis is where Googles Firebase steps in.</p>
<br>
<h2>Firebase for beginners</h2>

<p>Firebase is a  cloud-based comprehensive application development platform offered by Google. It provides a suite of tools and services to facilitate the creation, enhancement, and growth of web and mobile applications.</p>
<br>
<h2>Understanding Firebase</h2>

<p>Firebase is designed to simplify app development by offering a range of features, each addressing specific aspects of application building. It serves as a unified platform where developers can seamlessly integrate functionalities like databases, authentication, cloud storage, and more. It is backed by Google Cloud, which means that it is highly scalable and reliable.</p>
<br>
<h2>Firebase concept</h2>

<p>Firebase concept is simple. When you build a client-side app with JavaScript or any of its frameworks, for instance, Google Firebase can turn this into a serverless app in no time. It also removes the need to manage databases yourself, as it does that for you.
<br><br>
    Therefore, implementing Firebase means plugging a ready-made backend into your client code to make it dynamic. Ultimately, it eliminates the need to write backend code from scratch and gives you a fully functional one instead.</p>
<h2>What is Firebase?</h2>

<p>Google Firebase is a mobile and web application development platform that helps in building apps.
<br>
It also offers features like authentication, database, storage, hosting etc. Its database provides powerful NoSQL cloud database allowing for real time synchronisation. Authentication is ensured through Firebase’s robust authentication service and Firebase integrates seamlessly with Google’s machine learning capabilities.
<br>
 It is a Baas (Backend-as-a-service) platform and takes care of the backend problems for you. FInally, its is highly scalable and very secure as it uses the same security as Google.
