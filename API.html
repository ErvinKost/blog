<h2>A little Introduction</h2>
<p>You are probably wondering what the hell are those things from the title and how are you going to learn them...
    <br>
    This is where this Blog comes to the rescue. I was once just like you. I heard these terms and thought to myself, "I am not learning this". 
    <br>
    Well, I have and it was fun. 
    This Blog will unlock your knowledge about APIs, Rest and GraphQL, and it will be easy and quick. <br>
    So buckle up, and please enjoy the ride!<br>
    P.S - If you are like me, feel free to chuck this post into the ChatGPT and make it sum it up üòÇ

<h2>What are APIs? </h2>
<p> <strong>APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces</strong>,are a powerful tool for connecting applications and services together. They allow different software programs to communicate with each other and share data. APIs are used in a wide variety of applications, including web services, mobile apps, and desktop software.</p>
<p>An API is a set of rules and specifications that define how two pieces of software can communicate with each other. It provides a way for one program to request data or functionality from another program.</p>
<p>APIs are typically designed to be easy to use and understand. They are typically implemented using HTTP requests and JSON responses. This makes it easy for developers to use APIs in their own applications.</p>
<h2>There are many benefits to using APIs: </h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity:</strong> APIs allow developers to break down their code into smaller, more manageable modules. This makes it easier to maintain and update the code.</li>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> APIs can be reused in different applications. This can save developers a lot of time and effort.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> APIs can be scaled to handle large numbers of users and requests. This makes them ideal for building public web services and mobile apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use an API, you will need to read the API documentation. This will tell you how to make requests to the API and how to interpret the responses.</p>
<p>Most APIs require you to authenticate before you can make requests. This is typically done by providing an API key or token. You can usually obtain these from the API provider.</p>
<p>Once you have authenticated, you can start making requests to the API. Requests are typically made using HTTP GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE methods. The method you use will depend on the operation you want to perform.</p>
<p>For example, to retrieve a list of users from an API, you would make a GET request to the /users endpoint. To create a new user, you would make a POST request to the same endpoint.</p>
<p>The API will respond to your request with a JSON object. This object will contain the data or results that you requested.</p>
<h3>Here is a simple code example of how to use an API in JavaScript:</h3>
<br>
<br>
<style>
    img{
        width: 50%;
    }
    div{
        display: flex;
        justify-content: center;
        align-items: center;
        transform: scale(1.2);
    }

</style>
<div>
    <img src="imgs/api.png" alt="This is GraphQL">
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>This code will make a GET request to the GitHub API to retrieve a list of all repositories for the user in google. If the request is successful, the code will parse the JSON response into a list of Python dictionaries, each of which represents a repository. The code will then iterate over the list of repositories and print the name of each repository to the console.

    This is a simple example of how to use an API to retrieve data. You can use APIs to retrieve data from a variety of sources, such as social media platforms, weather services, and news websites.</p>
<h2> Real life comparison</h2>
<p>Think of APIs like a librarian in a library. The librarian knows where all the books are and how to get them. The library catalogue is like an API's menu, listing available books. When you ask for a specific book, it's like making an API request. The shelves in the library are like the server where the books are stored. The book you get is like the API's response. Inside the book is information, similar to an API's data format. The library doesn't remember past borrowings, much like a stateless API. If a new edition of a book comes out, the library might have both versions for a while, like API versioning. APIs act as go-betweens, making it easy for different systems to share information, just like a librarian helps you find and borrow books.</p>
<h2>Here are a few examples of popular APIs:</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twitter API:</strong> This API allows developers to access Twitter data and functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Google Maps API:</strong> This API allows developers to integrate Google Maps into their applications.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe API:</strong> This API allows developers to accept payments online.</li>
<li><strong>SendGrid API:</strong> This API allows developers to send emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many resources available online that can teach you more about APIs. Here are a few suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Documentation:</strong> The best place to learn about an API is the API documentation. This will tell you how to make requests to the API and how to interpret the responses.</li>
<li><strong>API Tutorials:</strong> There are many API tutorials available online. These tutorials can teach you how to use specific APIs or how to use APIs in general.</li>
<li><strong>API Books:</strong> There are also a number of books available on APIs. These books can provide you with a more in-depth understanding of APIs and how to use them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>APIs are a powerful tool for connecting applications and services together. They are easy to use and can be used in a wide variety of applications. If you are a developer, I encourage you to learn more about APIs. They can help you to build better, more scalable applications.</p>
<br><br>
<p>I hope I explained APIs as clearly as possible. They are not too complicated but useful knowledge in your journey towards programming.</p>
